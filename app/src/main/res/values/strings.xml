    <string name="instructions">Photography Instructions:\n\nPlease take a photo of the wheel after it has been removed from the vehicle. If there is a decorative hubcap, please remove it before taking the photo.\n\nEnsure that the entire wheel is visible in the photo, and make sure that nothing obstructs the view of the tire, rim, bolt holes, or the central hole.\n\nPlease vary the photography parameters – use different angles each time, different lighting conditions, and at night, sometimes with flash and sometimes without flash.\n\nThank you very much for your cooperation!</string>
